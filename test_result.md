#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "üö® CRITICAL FRONTEND AUTHENTICATION FAILURE DISCOVERED: Executed comprehensive production profile page testing on https://ritzone-frontend-s3ik.onrender.com with user credentials b@b.com/Abcd@1234 as requested. üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Frontend authentication system is COMPLETELY BROKEN. EVIDENCE: 1) Login attempt fails - URL remains at /auth/login after clicking login button ‚ùå, 2) Profile page (/profile) redirects to login form instead of showing profile interface ‚ùå, 3) Profile sidebar elements not found (User Name: 'NOT_FOUND', Email shows login prompt text) ‚ùå, 4) All profile section buttons (Dashboard, Personal Info, Orders, Wishlist, Address Book, Payment Methods) missing - cannot access any profile functionality ‚ùå, 5) Page displays 'Welcome back! Please sign in to your account' instead of authenticated user data ‚ùå. üéØ CRITICAL FINDING: The reported 'dummy data' issue (user@example.com) is NOT a data fetching problem - it's because the frontend login system is completely non-functional. Users cannot authenticate, so profile components never load real data and fall back to placeholder states. üîß BACKEND vs FRONTEND STATUS: Backend APIs work perfectly (confirmed by previous testing), but frontend authentication flow is broken. URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Fix frontend login/authentication system to properly authenticate users and maintain session state. The profile page will continue showing dummy data until frontend authentication is repaired."

CRITICAL FINDING: Field mapping fix is NOT working - the issue is actually REVERSED from what was expected. üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: 1) Database Schema Reality: user_addresses table has columns 'street', 'zip_code', 'name', 'is_default' (confirmed in /app/backend/profile-enhancement-schema.sql) ‚úì, 2) Backend Code Mismatch: /app/backend/routes/profile.js tries to insert into non-existent columns 'address_line_1', 'postal_code', 'first_name'/'last_name' ‚ùå, 3) Error Confirmed: 'Could not find the address_line_1 column of user_addresses in the schema cache' ‚ùå. üìä TESTING RESULTS: 2/5 tests passed (40% success rate) - Authentication ‚úì, GET addresses ‚úì, POST/PUT/DELETE all fail due to schema mismatch. üîß SOLUTION REQUIRED: Backend code must be updated to use ACTUAL database column names (street, zip_code, name, is_default) instead of trying to map to non-existent columns (address_line_1, postal_code, first_name/last_name). The field mapping should work the opposite direction - backend should adapt to database schema, not expect different column names.
