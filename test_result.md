# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.

# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "JANUARY 2025 - DYNAMIC ADMIN PANEL HOMEPAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: Make the Admin Panel's Homepage Section (/admin/homepage) fully functional and dynamic, connecting it with Frontend, Backend, and Database. Admin should be able to ADD, EDIT, DELETE, REPLACE all text content and images on the Index Page including Hero Section (slider images and text), Shop by Category section (images and text), Featured Products section (images and text), and Bestsellers in Electronics section (images and text). Image upload should support both Browse (upload from device) and Image URL methods. Changes from admin panel should instantly reflect on live Index page without manual database edits or code changes."

current_user_request: "JANUARY 2025 - DYNAMIC ADMIN PANEL HOMEPAGE MANAGEMENT: Transform static admin panel homepage section into fully functional system. Admin panel (/admin/homepage) currently has dummy/static data but needs complete backend integration. Admin should manage all Index page content: Hero banners (slider images/text), Category sections (images/text), Featured Products content, Bestsellers content. Image uploads via Browse or URL input. All changes should be database-driven and instantly reflected on live homepage. Complete Frontend-Backend-Database synchronization required."

current_analysis:
  main_agent: "üöÄ DYNAMIC ADMIN PANEL HOMEPAGE MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION - JANUARY 2025:
    üìä CURRENT INDEX PAGE STATUS ANALYSIS:
    ‚úÖ DYNAMIC SECTIONS (Connected to Backend/Database): Hero banners (apiClient.getBanners), Categories (apiClient.getCategories), Featured Products (apiClient.getFeaturedProducts), Electronics Bestsellers (apiClient.getProductsByCategory)
    ‚ùå STATIC SECTIONS (Hardcoded): Prime Benefits section (completely hardcoded HTML), Hero fallback banners (used when API fails)
    üö® ADMIN PANEL STATUS: Currently NON-FUNCTIONAL - ContentEditor and ImageManager components don't save to backend, 'Save Changes' button does nothing, no backend integration
    
    üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
    PHASE 1: Database Schema Setup - Create homepage_sections, homepage_content, homepage_images, homepage_category_mapping, homepage_featured_products tables
    PHASE 2: Backend API Development - Create comprehensive homepage management APIs with CRUD operations and image upload handling  
    PHASE 3: Admin Panel Integration - Connect ContentEditor/ImageManager to backend, implement real Save functionality
    PHASE 4: Frontend Dynamic Integration - Update homepage to use admin-managed content, make Prime Benefits dynamic
    PHASE 5: Testing & Verification - Complete workflow testing from admin panel to live site
    
    üîß TECHNICAL APPROACH: Extend existing banner system with comprehensive homepage management, support both Browse and URL image uploads, ensure instant reflection of changes"
    ‚úÖ Backend Infrastructure: Node.js Express + Supabase running correctly on port 8001
    ‚úÖ Admin Users API: /api/admin/users returns user data when properly authenticated (60 users found)
    ‚úÖ Admin Login API: /api/auto-sync/auth/login works correctly with admin@ritzone.com credentials
    ‚úÖ Session Validation API: /api/auto-sync/auth/validate properly validates admin sessions
    ‚úÖ Authentication Middleware: AutoSyncMiddleware.adminAuth validates sessions from cookies/headers
    
    üö® ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Cross-domain cookie authentication issue in production
    ‚ùå Cookie Configuration: Original config used sameSite='strict' which blocks cross-domain cookies
    ‚ùå Production Cross-Domain: Frontend (ritzone-frontend.onrender.com) and Backend (ritkart-backend.onrender.com) on different domains
    
    ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Enhanced cross-domain cookie configuration
    ‚úÖ Production Cookie Fix: Changed sameSite from 'strict' to 'none' for production cross-domain requests
    ‚úÖ Domain Configuration: Added domain handling for Render.com subdomains
    ‚úÖ Security Maintained: Secure flag properly set for production HTTPS
    ‚úÖ CORS Enhancement: Added X-Admin-Token header support for alternative authentication
    
    READY FOR PRODUCTION TESTING: Cookie authentication should now work between different domains"
