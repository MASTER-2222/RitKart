# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  RitZone User Review System Implementation:
  
  PREVIOUS COMPLETION STATE:
  - ‚úÖ Admin Panel (/admin/products) fully functional with CRUD operations for all 345 products
  - ‚úÖ Reviews field added and working in admin panel for admin-created reviews
  - ‚úÖ Backend API supports reviews field in all endpoints
  - ‚úÖ Frontend displays admin-created reviews on individual product pages
  - ‚úÖ Complete categorization system working with 10 categories (345 products total)
  
  NEW REQUIREMENTS - USER REVIEW SUBMISSION SYSTEM:
  1. ADD USER REVIEW FORM: Registered users should be able to submit reviews on individual product pages (/product/[id])
  2. REVIEW CONTENT: Each user review should include:
     - Review text/content (required)
     - Rating (1-5 stars, required)
     - User's personal experience
     - Image upload capability (optional) - Users can upload photos with their reviews
  3. DATABASE INTEGRATION: User reviews should be stored in database and connected to existing backend
  4. ADMIN MANAGEMENT: Administrators should be able to view/edit/delete user-submitted reviews from admin panel (/admin/products)
  5. FRONTEND DISPLAY: User reviews should be displayed alongside existing admin reviews on product pages
  
  GOAL: Complete user review system allowing registered users to submit reviews with images, while maintaining admin control over all review content through existing admin panel.
