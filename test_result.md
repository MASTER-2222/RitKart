# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  RitZone Profile Page Dynamic Enhancement:
  
  PREVIOUS COMPLETION STATE:
  - ✅ Cart Page "You might also like" enhancement completed with dynamic related products
  - ✅ Admin Panel (/admin/products) fully functional with CRUD operations for all 345 products
  - ✅ Reviews field added and working in admin panel for admin-created reviews
  - ✅ Backend API supports reviews field in all endpoints
  - ✅ Frontend displays admin-created reviews on individual product pages
  - ✅ Complete categorization system working with 10 categories (345 products total)
  - ✅ User Review System partially implemented (backend ready, database schema issue resolved)
  - ✅ Related Products API implemented and tested (GET /api/products/:id/related) - working perfectly
  
  NEW REQUIREMENTS - PROFILE PAGE DYNAMIC ENHANCEMENT:
  1. ISSUE: Currently, the Profile Page (/profile) for registered users displays static/dummy/hardcoded data
  2. SECTIONS TO MAKE DYNAMIC:
     - Dashboard: Dynamic user statistics, recent orders, wishlist count, cart items
     - Personal Info: Real user data from authentication/database with edit functionality
     - My Orders: Real orders from database with proper status, tracking, actions
     - Wishlist: Real wishlist items from database with product details
     - Address Book: Real saved addresses from database with CRUD operations
     - Payment Methods: Real payment methods from database with CRUD operations
  3. FUNCTIONALITY:
     - All sections must fetch data from Backend and Database (not hardcoded/static)
     - User-specific data synchronized with authentication
     - Full CRUD operations where applicable
     - Dynamic statistics and counts
  4. ADMIN PANEL SYNCHRONIZATION:
     - Same data visible in Admin Panel under Users Section (/admin/users)
     - Two-way synchronization: User Profile Page ↔ Backend/Database ↔ Admin Panel
     - Profile Info section in admin must show same dynamic data
  5. IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:
     - Create backend API endpoints for profile data operations
     - Update frontend components to fetch and display real user data
     - Implement proper authentication-based data fetching
     - Ensure admin panel shows same synchronized data
  6. CONSTRAINTS:
     - Don't change environment variables for backend and frontend
     - Use .env.local for development if necessary
     - Frontend is in root folder, backend is in backend folder
  
  GOAL: Convert static Profile Page into dynamic, database-driven interface with full synchronization between user profile and admin panel.
