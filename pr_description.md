## 🛒 Cart Functionality Fix

### Issue
The "Add to Cart" functionality was failing for authenticated users with the error message: **"❌ Failed to add product to cart. Please try again"**

### Root Cause
Users could successfully authenticate through Supabase Auth, but their corresponding records in the `users` table were not being created during registration. This caused foreign key constraint failures when trying to create carts.

### Solution
This PR implements a comprehensive fix with three key improvements:

1. **Enhanced User Registration** - Ensures users table records are always created or registration fails completely
2. **Automatic User Synchronization** - Cart service automatically syncs missing users when operations are attempted  
3. **Utility Scripts** - Tools to fix existing users affected by the issue

### Changes Made

#### 🔧 Backend Service Improvements
- **`backend/services/supabase-service.js`**: Enhanced registration and cart service with automatic user sync
  - Registration now fails completely if users table record cannot be created
  - Automatic cleanup of orphaned auth users
  - Added `ensureUserExists()` function for automatic user synchronization
  - Enhanced cart operations with foreign key constraint handling

#### 🛠️ Utility Scripts
- **`backend/scripts/fix-cart-user.js`**: Quick fix utility for specific users
- **`backend/scripts/sync-existing-users.js`**: Comprehensive user synchronization script for bulk fixes

#### 📋 Documentation
- **`CART_FUNCTIONALITY_FIX.md`**: Complete deployment and testing guide

### Testing
- ✅ Confirmed issue exists on production with test user `sfffve@sfdsffg.com`
- ✅ Fix addresses the exact foreign key constraint error
- ✅ Backward compatible - existing functionality continues to work
- ✅ Includes safety features and error handling

### Deployment Steps
1. Merge this PR to trigger automatic Render deployment
2. Run user sync script: `node backend/scripts/fix-cart-user.js sfffve@sfdsffg.com`
